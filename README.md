# Tic Tac Toe game

Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, youâ€™ll manage state across parent and child components. You'll also work through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

## Define the React component lifecycle

1. Manage state globally at the application level
2. Manage state locally at the component level
3. Use React Hooks and methods
4. Describe how a parent component communicates with a child component
5. Identify parent/child components and their state
6. Mount and unmount components
7. Practice communicating technical decisions you made
